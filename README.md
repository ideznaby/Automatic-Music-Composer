# Automatic-Music-Composer
Our vision of a creative artist or a music composer is usually very romantic. A person standing on a roof with the wind blowing in his hair and suddenly he gets an idea of a full opera and sits down and starts to write it. It has been vision of the music for decades now. In fact if you ask people no one will believe that a machine can create music which gives different feelings to human. Everyone believes that such a music should be created by something that has actual feelings and the only thing that has these feelings is human. But the truth is music is a sequence of numbers so it can be calculated and created by a machine. The aim of our program is to develop a software that can create music according to different feelings . We used a customized Hidden Markov Model to create this program.
